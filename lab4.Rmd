1. There are 1,258 observations in the new dataset, after we filter for observations that have a carat weight of 0.5.
```{r}
data <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat == 0.5)
glimpse(data)
```


2. As shown in the histogram, the two levels of cut with the smallest number of observations are "few" and "good".

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Cut")
```

# Exercise 3
```{r}
lumpeddata <- data %>%
  mutate(cut = fct_lump_n(cut, n=3))

ggplot(data = lumpeddata, aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Cut")
```


```{r}

```
